## Description

A time ago we have decided to move all parts of the Nsys Platform project from repository hosted by our organization to GitHub. 
The goal is to open this project to a bigger audience and we hope it will help to transform this project more as a community activity. 
The incubation time for transfer will take a time and should be done later this year. During that time we will transfer individual 
components of the platform to GitHub. Stay tuned and follow us at [@nsys_org](https://twitter.com/nsys_org). If you have any
questions about this project, please [contact us](mailto:info@nsys.org).
